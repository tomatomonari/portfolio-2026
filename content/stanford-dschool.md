## Three days of fully immersive design thinking

The Stanford d.school Boot Camp is an intensive program for professionals who want to level up through design thinking. I attended through a Japanese government-funded Stanford program.

In teams of about five people, each with a dedicated d.school design thinking coach, we worked on a problem statement posed by an NPO: **"How might we improve digital health?"**

Over three days, we learned:
- How to run interviews and pull real insights
- How to diverge on ideas and then converge on the strongest one
- How to prototype and test quickly
- How to pitch the solution

The whole process was hands-on — our coaches were seasoned practitioners who guided us through every step. The d.school staff also ran workshops throughout the program.

## I ran a workshop at the d.school!

Here's the part I didn't expect.

The d.school runs paid workshops for people wanting to learn design thinking. Our final challenge: **teach a 90-minute workshop** to those paid attendees.

Prep time: about one hour.

These participants had no idea their "teachers" had just gone through a 3-day program themselves. The feedback afterward: *"You guys are experts!"*

That moment proved how much we'd actually absorbed — and how effective the d.school's approach is.

## What I took away

**Speed of execution:** I was shocked how fast we validated ideas. Interview someone for 20 minutes, synthesize for 10, prototype for 30 — then test again. The whole cycle happened multiple times per day. It proved that momentum matters more than perfection.

**Actionable hunch:** A concept from a well-known d.school instructor. When you're diverging and have tons of insights, filter by asking: *Can I prototype and validate this?* Not just interesting — testable. It changed how I converge on problems.

**Actions lead to creativity:** Core d.school philosophy. Don't wait for ideas, just act. Action → creativity → more action. Even without full knowledge, starting action unlocks creativity.

**Jump in with what you have:** It's rare that everything is clear. There's always uncertainty. But gather the data you have, take action anyway, and more ideas will come. Waiting for perfect information means waiting forever.

At the end of the Boot Camp, I became a **d.school Certified Design Thinker**.
