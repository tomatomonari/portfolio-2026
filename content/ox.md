## Wearable-guided warehouse operations

Ox built software that guided warehouse operators through tasks using wearable devices. Think: smart glasses and wrist-mounted devices telling workers exactly where to go and what to pick.

- **Employee #21:** Joined right after the company landed its first major customer
- **3-year journey:** Post-seed scramble → Series A growth (20→50 people) → contraction (two layoffs)
- **Role evolution:** Junior PM → leading cross-functional standups → reporting directly to COO during crisis

## What I shipped

### API Infrastructure Overhaul

Our original APIs were built for one customer with customer-specific terms. Couldn't scale. I led a year-long initiative with the CTO to rebuild into modular, abstract APIs that worked for any customer and use case.

- **3x customer scale:** Platform could now support multiple enterprise customers simultaneously
- **20% cost reduction:** Optimized infrastructure spending while improving performance
- **67% faster onboarding:** New customers went live in weeks, not months
- **Avoided 3x engineering headcount:** Automation replaced manual integration work

### Visibility — 0-to-1 Product

Operators had our app telling them what to do — but managers had no view into what was happening. I owned the full lifecycle: research, scoping, development, launch, iteration.

- **NPS 70+:** Managers loved having live visibility into tasks and operator performance
- **Became signature product:** Shifted sales conversations from users to buyers
- **Full ownership:** Research → scoping → development → launch → iteration

### Customer Integration & Onboarding

Led integrations with enterprise customers — running onboarding calls, mapping as-is to to-be workflows, coordinating across internal and external teams.

- **Legacy system partnership:** Turned a near-conflict with a 1970s-era system partner into a strong partnership by bringing in the right people and strategizing every meeting

## How I worked

- **With Engineering:** Partnered with CTO and engineering directors on API architecture, infrastructure decisions, and sprint planning. Made sure devs could focus on building, not sitting in meetings.

- **With Design:** Worked closely with a lean design team (sometimes just one junior designer). Led product thinking when design resources were stretched.

- **With Business/CS:** Constant tension between platform investment and feature requests. I was in the room with CS directors, explaining why long-term infrastructure mattered more than short-term asks.

- **During Crisis:** When projects fell behind and the COO called a "war room," I became his right hand — leading daily standups across all teams, compiling updates, coordinating eng/CS/product to get three enterprise customers launched.

## What I learned

Startups don't wait for you to be ready. I learned PM by doing — Jira, PRDs, supply chain domain, facilitating cross-functional meetings.

- **Platform investment is a hard sell:** But worth fighting for
- **When everything's on fire:** Staying calm and organized is a superpower
- **Trust is everything:** If your partners don't trust you, nothing else matters
