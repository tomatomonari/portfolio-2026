## From waiting in line to winning $10K

I kept waiting an hour at the same restaurant — physically writing my name on a whiteboard like it was 1995. I thought: this is stupid, let me build a waitlist solution.

Then I actually talked to restaurant owners.

## The pivot that changed everything

After interviewing ~30 restaurant owners, I discovered they didn't care about waitlists. What they cared about: **COVID had just forced them to go digital, and they were drowning.**

Physical menus disappeared overnight. Restaurants scrambled to adopt food delivery apps, QR codes, digital everything. Menu generation was the breaking point — they didn't have time or skills to do it themselves, and hiring designers was expensive.

The insight: if digital menus are becoming standardized anyway, why not make conversion dead simple?

## What I built

A platform where restaurant owners could:
- Upload their PDF menu
- Automatically get an interactive digital menu
- No designer needed, no technical skills required

Based on customer research (100+ diners interviewed), I added what people actually wanted:
- Pictures of menu items
- Dietary filters (gluten-free, vegetarian)
- Clean, browsable interface

**The product decision that mattered:**

We debated building data tracking first (eye tracking, click analytics - the real differentiator) vs. menu generation (the immediate pain point).

Data tracking would take longer to implement and was harder to demonstrate value. Restaurant owners needed to FEEL the value - menu generation did that through beautiful UI and easy onboarding. For pitching, we could talk about future data features without building them, but we needed a working menu product to show.

We chose menu generation. Restaurants needed it NOW or they'd be left behind. Data tracking could come later.

In hindsight: this decision was right. We got real-time feedback from restaurant owners on the working product, and the live demo made our pitch competition presentation tangible.

## The competition nobody expected us to enter

Arkansas Governor's Cup was for graduate students — MBAs and PhDs who'd worked on their ideas for 1+ years. We were one of only **two undergrad teams** that year, and we decided to enter **last minute**.

We had one month to prepare against teams with a year of work.

**How we divided and conquered:**

I owned customer discovery and product direction entirely - turning vision into Figma designs and PRDs. Gustavo implemented everything in a super lightweight way so we could iterate quickly and get user feedback. Olivia (our third co-founder) handled the business side - pitch deck, competitive analysis, financials.

I also worked closely with Justin Urso, the Studio director and our mentor. He's a restaurant owner himself with startup experience. I constantly brought him feedback, and he'd push back or validate our direction. I implemented his feedback fast - pitch iterations, strategy adjustments, everything. That cycle of feedback → rapid iteration kept us sharp.

We pulled all-nighters to get the MVP ready - no AI back then, everything manual.

**Result: 2nd place, $10,000**

The judges said our customer discovery set us apart. It wasn't just an idea — we had real data, a working product, and a problem everyone could relate to.

**The validation:** Our customer discovery led us to the right problem at the right time. We just weren't the ones who could scale it.

## What this taught me

This was my first true 0-to-1 experience. Everything I'd learned about design thinking finally came together in a real product with real stakes.

**The skill that stuck:** Let data drive the solution. I started with one idea (waitlist), killed it based on research, and pivoted to something the market actually wanted. That discipline — being obsessed with the problem, not the solution — shapes how I work today.
