## Where I discovered what I actually wanted to do

I walked into McMillon Innovation Studio as a junior in 2020 because I saw a flyer about prototyping. I was learning UX/UI design and wanted to practice.

What I found changed my trajectory.

I'd been studying computer science, but I felt like "one of the wheels" — executing on someone else's vision. Design thinking felt different. It felt like **the core of the business**: finding problems and actually solving them.

Before the Studio, I hadn't really found people who matched the energy I was looking for. Then I met students who knew how to network, get internships, land jobs — high-agency people who were going places. I wanted to be part of that.

Joining the Studio connected me to the community, taught me design thinking, opened doors to internships, and eventually led me to product management. The principles I learned there — design thinking, cross-functional leadership, user empathy — are still core to how I work as a PM today.

## What McMillon Studio is

Founded in 2018 and funded by Doug McMillon (CEO of Walmart), the Studio is a cross-disciplinary space where undergrads work on real business challenges.

**How it works:**
- Enterprise partners (Walmart, Sam's Club, P&G, J&J, hospitals, NPOs) pose challenges as "How Might We" statements
- Student teams form: 1 leader + 3-4 members from different disciplines
- Semester-long design thinking process: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
- Demo Day pitch to senior executives as judges

It's one of the few places on campus for true cross-functional collaboration — business, engineering, bio, graphic design, architecture students all working together.

## What I have done

### As a Project Manager (2020-2022)

Led cross-functional teams through design thinking projects, solving real problems for Fortune 500 partners:

- **P&G** — Retail innovation
- **Johnson & Johnson + Walmart** — On-time delivery optimization (year-long project in conjunction with P&G)
- **Bento** — My own entrepreneurial venture, built and pitched through the Studio

### As a Graduate Assistant (2025-Present)

Came back while finishing my Master's. Last semester we didn't have a director, so the other GA and I ran everything. Still essentially operating the program.

**This semester's results:**
- **150 applications, ~130 showed up** at kickoff — double the previous record of ~80
- **18 projects** — highest ever (credit to the new director for bringing in partners)
- Revamped the ideation workshop with industry frameworks (ROST, etc.) that translate to actual PM work
