## A portfolio site built like a product

Resumes are flat. LinkedIn is noisy. I needed a way to show how I think — not just what I've done.

## Problem

Traditional portfolios either look like a resume dump or a design showcase with no substance. Neither works for product roles where hiring managers care about judgment, tradeoffs, and shipping ability.

## What I built

- **Full-stack portfolio** using Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion — vibecoded end-to-end with Claude Code
- **Content-driven architecture** where each experience has its own detail page with markdown rendering
- **Scroll-driven interactions** and smooth transitions that feel polished without sacrificing performance
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with a custom animated navbar and section navigation
- **Version-controlled and deployed professionally** — maintained through Git and GitHub, hosted on Vercel with CI/CD

## Decisions & tradeoffs

- **Why code over no-code?** Squarespace can't express craft. Building it myself signals I can work alongside engineers and ship real software — not just wireframes.
- **Why Claude Code + Git + Vercel over Replit?** Real dev workflow matters. Using Claude Code in the terminal, committing through Git, deploying through Vercel — that's the actual stack engineers use. It shows I can operate in their world, not just drag-and-drop in a sandbox.
- **Why markdown for content?** Keeps content portable and easy to iterate on without touching React components. Add a `.md` file, get a new page.
- **Why one page with sections?** The audience (hiring managers, product leaders) has 30 seconds. A single scroll tells the full story. Detail pages exist for the curious.

## UX philosophy

I wanted this to be fun to visit and scroll through — not just a bland page. Lots of color, smooth animations, interactive elements. But I was careful not to make it cluttered or noisy. Visually appealing without sacrificing readability. Every animation serves the experience, nothing is there just to show off.

## Outcome

A high-performance portfolio that treats the job search like a product problem — clear audience, clear JTBD, fast iteration. Built and shipped in days, not weeks.
